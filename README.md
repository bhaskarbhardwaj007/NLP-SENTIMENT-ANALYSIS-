# NLP-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-
This project trains a model for Sentiment Analysis; and in the end predict the new data. NOTE:- (THIS PROJECT WILL IMPROVE YOUR INSIGHT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF NLP).

# Prerequisites:-
1. You should know basics about the Google colab. (Do not worry if you do not know, I will mention below in "How to use the code" section)
2. For dataset thanks to Ziqi Yuan to provide the data on kaggle. Below is the link to Ziqi Yuan's dataset:-<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/columbine/imdb-dataset-sentiment-analysis-in-csv-format
3. %tensorflow_version 2.x version   #(already inside the code)   #it can work only in colab     
4. from google.colab import drive<br>
   drive.mount('/content/drive')      #(inside the code)
   
# How to use the code:-
1. Open Google colab
2. Sign in
3. Upload code file

# Process to execute:-
1. Download the data using the link mentioned on line number 2   # (in "Prerequisites" section above) .
2. Extract the data.
3. Upload the extracted data to Google drive
4. Link the Google drive with Google colab   #(This step is included in the code)
5. Copy the path of your data which is now inside your Google colab, and paste it after 'pd.read_csv('paste_here')'

# Feel free to use the code
